# How to activate the shield

`!shield on`

Accounts created on the same day they join your server will be kicked.

# Top 3 things to do

### 1. Create an administrator role named 'bot' assigned to Proxy

Set this role in the uppermost position:

![bot_role_img](/attachments/bot_role.png?raw=true)

You can also set Proxy's role directly in the uppermost position as well.

### 2. Set a default role

`!role @aRoleFromYourServer`

This role will be automatically assigned to members who join your server.

### 3. Set a default notification channel

`!chan #aTextChannelFromYourServer`

This channel will be used to welcome members who join your server.

# Hosting

Proxy is currently hosted 24/7 on a VPS and uses MariaDB for its database.
